            Welcome! I&apos;m Abeih Hamani, a Computer Science student at the
            City College of New York, expected to graduate in Spring 2028. I
            taught myself everything I know about web development — from HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript to React, Node.js, and MongoDB — with the
            exception of C++, which I studied in CSC-103.
          </p>

            I&apos;m passionate about applying what I learn to create useful,
            well-designed projects. From FinancePal to CareerLink and
            ResumeBuilder, I&apos;ve explored how to combine functionality with
            clean design, and I&apos;m always looking for the next challenge to
            push my skills further.
